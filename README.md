I chose this project as a platform for myself or anyone to have access to a personal blog/diary where users are able to create customized posts of their daily thoughts and encounters.
In addition, it could be converted into a note taking platform as well for students where it provides security for them to be the only one to have access to their notes.

# Challenges
Biggest challenge for me is when getting the codes to sync with authentication.

# Future Developments
If we are given an apportunity to revisit this project, I would

- Improve UI/UX
- Add more features
