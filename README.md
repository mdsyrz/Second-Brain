Second Brain is a blogging platform for everyone to have access to a personal blog/diary where you are able to create customized posts of your daily thoughts and encounters.
In addition, students can also use it as a note taking platform. It provides security for them to be the only one to have access to their notes or any other personal data of theirs.

## Challenges
Biggest challenge for me is when getting the codes to sync with authentication.
